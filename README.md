# Testing
## Responsivness
All pages was tested to be responsive dow to 280px (Samsung Galaxy Fold) which I belive has the smallest screen width at the moment. The page was tested in Chrome, Firefox and Safari both on computer and on mobile.

#### Steps of testing:
<ol>
<li>Open browser and navigate to 

https://linusheinsvig.github.io/sofieheinsvig/index.html
<li>Open developer tools (right click and pick inspect)
<li>Chose responsive and set width to 280px
<li>Set zoom to 50%
<li>Drag the responsive window to maximum width
</ol>

#### Expected:
Website is responsive on all screen sizes with no elements overlapping and no horizontal scroll

#### Results:
Website is behaving well, the hero-image can cause a small amount of sidescroll at some sizes but other than that all the text is readable and no overlapping found

Devices used to test website:
<ul>
<li>Macbook Air
<li>Macbook Air with 32 inch external monitor
<li>Iphone 12
<li>Iphone 12 Max
</ul>

## Unfixed Bugs
<hr>

### Contact Form
The contact form does not send your message anywhere because it needs a Javascript to work correctly.
This is somethink I hope to fix in a later relese.

### Hero Image
The Hero image does not scale correctly on all devices.
I did not have time to find a solution for this in time but defenitly something I will fix in a later relese.

### Acting & Gallery page
Both the acting and the gallery page runs a bit slow because of the images and the video.
There is probably a solution to this and also something I would work on for a later relese.
