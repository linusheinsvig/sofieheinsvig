        <h1 class="gallery-heading">Acting</h1>
        <p>First time I ever stood on a stage I was 16 years old. It was love at first sight, or well, 
            not so much sight, cause I was honestly completely blinded by the stage lights. 
            But once I’d taken that first step up there, I was not coming back down. 
            From there started my journey of becoming an actress, interrupted several times by life, 
            as all journeys are. But it took me to Katrineberg to study method acting, 
            it took me to Wendelsberg to rediscover my joy in improvisation. 
            It took me through Gothenburg and dinner theatre shows, 
            to the outskirts of London and a tiny shared flat in persuit of a dream. And now it’s taken me here,
            back to my hometown where it all started. A place I didn’t think was big enough to fit my dreams back then. 
            But as one often learns as one grows up, the things we know as teenagers and the 
            things that prove to be true as adults might not always match up. But one thing did though. 
            That first love I felt when I stepped on a stage for the first time? Still there. </p>
